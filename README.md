Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project This project uses sentiment analysis techniques to analyze public sentiment during the 2020 election by analyzing Twitter data. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights into how people felt about political events, candidates, and issues based on Twitter posts.



Overview:
By collecting tweets related to the 2020 election and processing the data through natural language processing (NLP) techniques, I used sentiment analysis models to classify the tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. The analysis includes visualizations and detailed reports on sentiment trends across different periods during the election, highlighting key moments and shifts in public opinion.

Python: For scripting and data processing.
Tweepy: For accessing the Twitter API and collecting tweet data.
TextBlob / VaderSentiment: For sentiment analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib / Seaborn: For visualizing the sentiment trends.
Jupyter Notebooks: For organizing and presenting the analysis.
Key Features:
Tweet Collection: Data collection from Twitter using the Twitter API to gather relevant tweets.
Sentiment Analysis: Classifying tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
Trend Visualization: Graphs showing sentiment trends over time, across different topics, and events.
Key Insights: Identification of moments during the election with the most significant public sentiment shifts.
Project Purpose:
The primary aim of this project is to provide insight into how public sentiment shifted during key moments in the election cycle. By using social media data, this analysis offers a window into public perception, helping to identify key themes and emotions tied to political events.
